# Ruby Clock Radio Project

By Chris Larsen

Ruby v- 2.2.1

This is a simple IoT clock radio. 

Hardware is a Raspberry Pi B+ with a 2.8" touchscreen.

Radio is played through streaming internet radio stations, and controlled with the ruby-mpd gem at https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby-mpd.

The clock is updated through the system clock, and displayed in red with a black background.

GUI is made possible by using the Gtk3 gem at https://rubygems.org/gems/gtk3

# To Do

At this point, all that is needed is hardware. I will have to find a suitable enclosure, and a speaker that can be connected to the audio jack.
