# Ruby Clock Radio Project

By Chris Larsen

Ruby v- 2.3.3

This is a simple IoT clock radio.

Hardware is a Raspberry Pi B+ with a 2.8" touchscreen.

Radio is played through streaming internet radio stations, and controlled with the [ruby-mpd](https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby-mpd) gem.

The clock is updated through the system clock.

GUI is made possible by using the [Gtk3](https://rubygems.org/gems/gtk3) gem

Files for 3D printable casing can be found [here](https://a360.co/2QgYqZv).
