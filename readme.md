# Ruby Clock Radio Project

By Chris Larsen

Ruby v- 2.2.1

This is a simple IoT clock radio. 

Hardware is a Raspberry Pi B+ with a 2.8" touchscreen.

Radio is played through streaming internet radio stations, and controlled with the ruby-mpd gem at https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby-mpd.

The clock is updated through the system clock, and displayed in red with a black background.

GUI is made possible by using the Gtk3 gem at https://rubygems.org/gems/gtk3

# To Do

Improve the styling using CSS. The interface will look much nicer when completed.

Design and 3D print a case for the entire project. This will require identifying some simple speakers.
